## Adopticum Photo Collector

Use Adopticum Photo Collector app to capture and upload photos as a group effort.

Collecting photos to build a dataset is a group effort. Adopticum Photo Collector captures photos with the camera on your smartphone. You can select which photos are uploaded to shared collections. Photos are not saved to your phone’s regular photo library, thus separating dataset images from your personal photos.
